# Extra Apple Rules for [Bazel](https://bazel.build)

This repository contains additional rules for [Bazel](https://bazel.build) that
can be used to build libraries for Apple platforms.

## Reference documentation

### `objc_library`

Produces a static library from the given Objective-C source files, with support
for header maps.

In iOS development, conventionally, when depending on an Objective-C library,
you can import its public headers using the system include syntax (`#import
<MyLibrary/MyLibrary.h>`) regardless of their location on the file sytem.
However, in Bazel, you have to explicitly specify the location of the imported
headers from the relatively from the included directories (`#import
"external/MyLibrary/MyLibrary.h"`). This rule wraps the native `objc_library`
rule to add support for the conventional import syntax, so that you won't have
to patch your libraries to support building with Bazel.

### `apple_resource_bundle`

Encapsulates a target which is provided to dependers as a bundle.

`apple_resource_bundle` rules coming from `rules_apple` doesn't have a
`bundle_id` attribute, and doesn't support substitution of
`DEVELOPMENT_LANGUAGE` and `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` variables which by
default exist in a resource bundle target generated by Xcode. This macro wraps
`rules_apple`'s `apple_resource_bundle` rule to modify the `Info.plist` files
under the hood before giving them to the original rule, so that users don't have
to manually hard code their plists in order to make their resource bundle
targets work with Bazel.

#### Reference

- https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/blob/0.19.0/doc/rules-resources.md#apple_resource_bundle
- https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/issues/679
- https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/pull/680
- https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/pull/681

## Quick setup

Add the following to your `WORKSPACE` file to add the external repositories,
replacing the commit hash in the `commit` attribute with the version of the
rules you wish to depend on:

```python
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git.bzl", "git_repository")

git_repository(
    name = "com_github_thii_rules_apple_extras",
    remote = "https://github.com/thii/rules_apple_extras.git",
    commit = "<latest commit hash here>",
)
```

## Examples

With a load statement at the top of your BUILD file, you can use this rule as
you would with the native `objc_library` rule.

```python
load("@com_github_thii_rules_apple_extras//apple:objc_library.bzl", "objc_library")

objc_library(
    name = "Lib",
    hdrs = [
        "Lib.h",
    ],
    srcs = glob([
        "**/*.m",
    ]),
)
```

Any target that depends on `Lib` will be able to import `Lib`'s public header
using `#import <Lib/Lib.h>` syntax.
